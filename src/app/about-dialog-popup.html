    <strong>Borealis</strong>, the Canadian Dataverse Repository, is a bilingual, multidisciplinary, secure, Canadian research data repository, supported by academic libraries and research institutions across Canada. Borealis supports open discovery, management, sharing, and preservation of Canadian research data.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Borealis Metrics Report allows users to curate and analyze usage data across the entire platform and within specific collections. The interface is available in English or <em>en français</em>. Please note that Collection names and data are represented in their original language, as are the corresponding metadata.
  </p>

  <p>
    Below is an overview of the features available in the Borealis Metrics Report, as well as a description of categories and filters users may choose to apply.
  </p>

  <h3><i>Left-hand Panel</i></h3>

  <h4><strong>Collections Tree</strong></h4>
  <p>
    The Collections Tree is a configuration tool that allows users to navigate and search over 1,500 collections in their intended, hierarchical data structure. Collections and subcollections follow a nested structure, with reports available for the collection as a whole or for specific subcollections.
  </p>
  <p>
    To view metrics for a specific collection or subcollection, click the <strong>“Full Report”</strong> button in the nested tree structure.
  </p>

  <h4><strong>Date Range</strong></h4>
  <p>
    Users can examine data within any specific timeframe, from its creation to the most recent month.
  </p>

  <h3><i>Centre and Right-hand Panel</i></h3>

  <h4><strong>Graph Dashboard</strong></h4>
  <p>
    Graphs are generated when the <strong>“Monthly”</strong> and/or <strong>“Cumulative”</strong> metrics are selected at the top of bar graphs or from the legend next to pie graphs. Graph data ranges will adjust based on the selected dates and collections.
  </p>

    <li><strong>PDF</strong> – Exports the graphs and right-hand panel metrics for the selected collections and date range into a single organized PDF.</li>
    <li><strong>Legacy</strong> – Structured data export from a previous version of the Borealis Metrics Report. Data in this export may be formatted differently than other export formats.</li>
    <li><strong>Make Data Count</strong> – Exports usage metrics compliant with Make Data Count standards for research data metrics.</li>
