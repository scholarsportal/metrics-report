  <h3><strong>Where is this data collected from?</strong></h3>
  <p>
    Data is collected through the Dataverse Metrics API. For more information, visit:
    <a href="https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/api/metrics.html" target="_blank">
      guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/api/metrics.html
    </a>
  </p>

  <h3><strong>What is “Borealis (All)”? </strong></h3>
  <p>
    “Borealis (All)” refers to the entirety of Borealis, meaning the data represents all data and collections in Borealis.
  </p>

  <h3><strong>Why isn’t X specific dataverse included in the report?</strong></h3>
  <p>
    It may take time for a new collection to be reflected in the source data. Additionally, collections must be published, not in draft mode, to be included.
  </p>

  <h3><strong>Why isn’t my collection displayed in French/English?</strong></h3>
  <p>
    Collections are displayed in their original, published language. While the interface will update to match the language selected by the user, collection data will not.
  </p>

  <h3><strong>What does “Legacy” mean for data download?</strong></h3>
  <p>
    The Legacy download option provides a structured data export that was hosted on the previous version of the Borealis Metrics Report. Data in this export may be formatted differently from other available export formats such as Make Data Count.
  </p>

  <h3><strong>What is Make Data Count?</strong></h3>
  <p>
    Make Data Count is a third-party, community-led initiative that promotes the development of open data metrics to meaningfully assess data usage and impact. The intention is to establish standardized metrics for usage data such as views, downloads and citations that can be applied broadly across datasets and repository platforms to encourage collaboration and data sharing practices.
  </p>
  <p>
    Make Data Count is part of a larger initiative through the Research Data Alliance’s Data Usage Metrics Working Group, and is operated in collaboration with DataCite. Make Data Count is unique in its focus on community-driven standards and its dedication to open metrics for widespread collaboration and adoption across the research data landscape.
  </p>
  <p>
    Make Data Count developed the COUNTER Code of Practice for Research Data, the standard used to track views and downloads in the Borealis Metrics Report. The Borealis Metrics Report also uses the DataCite Citation Corpus, co-developed by DataCite and Make Data Count, to provide citation metrics for data in Borealis.
  </p>

  <h3><strong>It’s the first day of the month — why isn’t data from this month included in the report?</strong></h3>
  <p>
    It can take a few business days (typically 3–5) for the current month’s data to appear in the metrics.
  </p>

  <h3><strong>Why can’t I access metrics specific to my institution for the Odesi collection?</strong></h3>
  <p>
    Following the Odesi redevelopment and migration from Nesstar to Borealis in 2023, the majority of data in Odesi is now open. As part of this transition, we no longer collect or provide institution-level metrics.
  </p>
