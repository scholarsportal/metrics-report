    <h3><strong>What is Borealis (All)?</strong></h3>
    <p>
      Borealis (All) refers to the entirety of Borealis — meaning the data represents all dataverses combined.
    </p>
  
    <h3><strong>Why isn’t this specific dataverse included?</strong></h3>
    <p>
      It may take time for a dataverse to be reflected in the source data. Also, dataverses must be published to be included.
    </p>
  
    <h3><strong>Why isn’t my dataverse displayed in French?</strong></h3>
    <p>
      Dataverses are displayed in their original, published language.
    </p>
  
    <h3><strong>What is Legacy?</strong></h3>
    <p>
      Legacy is a structured data export that was previously hosted on the older version of the Dataverse Metrics Page.
    </p>
  
    <h3><strong>What is DataCite / MakeDataCount?</strong></h3>
    <p>
      MakeDataCount is a third-party, community-led project that tracks metrics such as downloads, views, and citations for files, datasets, and dataverses within Borealis.
    </p>
  
    <h3><strong>It’s the first of the month — why isn’t this month included?</strong></h3>
    <p>
      It can take a few business days (typically 3–5) for the current month’s data to appear in the metrics.
    </p>
